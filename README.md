## Abstract

In today's world, where internet connectivity has become crucial for education and work, power cuts can disrupt online activities and cause inconvenience to students and employees. The Solar WiFi Router addresses this problem by integrating a 12V rechargeable battery, which can be charged using AC power or solar power. During power cuts, the router switches to battery power using a relay, ensuring continuous WiFi access and LED lighting. The device also features real-time battery charging and manual control switches for added flexibility.

## Introduction

Solar Wi-Fi Router is an innovative project that aims to create a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for providing Wi-Fi connectivity using solar power. This project is designed to harness solar energy and use it to power a Wi-Fi router, enabling internet connectivity in remote and off-grid locations.

The motivation behind this project is to bridge the digital divide and bring internet access to areas where traditional power sources are limited or unavailable. By utilizing renewable solar energy, the Solar Wi-Fi Router contributes to a greener and more sustainable future.

## Features

- Continuous WiFi and LED operation during power cuts
- Switch between AC power, solar power, and battery power
- Real-time battery charging
- User-friendly manual control switches
- Efficient power management

## Components

The project utilizes various electronic components, including:

- LM317T Regulator
- Zener diode (6.8V)
- Rectifier Module (1A)
- Relay Module (24V, 12V)
- Switches and LEDs
- 12V rechargeable battery
- and more

## Installation

Provide detailed installation instructions here. Include any necessary hardware requirements, software dependencies, and step-by-step installation procedures. You may also include commands for package installation and configuration.

## Usage

Explain how to use the Solar Wi-Fi Router here. Include instructions on how to connect devices to the Wi-Fi network, access the router's admin panel, and any other relevant details.

For example:

1. Connect the 230V AC adapter to the "A/C power in" pin.
2. Connect the WiFi router cable to the "Wi-Fi" pin.
3. Optionally, connect the solar panel cable to the solar panel pin.
4. Configure the device according to your requirements using the manual control switches.
5. Enjoy uninterrupted WiFi access and LED lighting, even during power cuts!
