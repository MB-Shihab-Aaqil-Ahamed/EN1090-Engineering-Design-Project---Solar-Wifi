# EN1090 Engineering Design Project - Solar-Wifi

## Solar wifi with multiple functionlaity

In this module we were asked build an electronic product/project which solves the real world problems. But luckily as a team, we got an amazing idea, as you all the world,Sri Lanka had faced economic crisis due to the shortage of foreign exhange, at that time shortage of fuel affect all the sectors especially Education. Mainly the power cut was the serious consequence for the Education and IT sector, as all you know due to that problem all the studies were hold online, many of the students use wi-fi, light (plays major role in night time)  at all the instances of their educational, IT industrial needs. As an undergraduate, group members altogether collaboratively planned to build above titled project. When the power gone here we are using LDR circuit to enable the solar circuit to charge the battery until that as usual adapter circuit charge the battery. To indicate the charge levels we are using two(red, green) LEDs when the battery(12V) charge is full red LED turn on until that green will turn on to indicate that the battery(12V) is charging, and we annex the wi-fi, LED to charged battery(12V) to achieve our objective.
