## Introduction

Solar Wi-Fi Router is an innovative project that aims to create a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for providing Wi-Fi connectivity using solar power. This project is designed to harness solar energy and use it to power a Wi-Fi router, enabling internet connectivity in remote and off-grid locations.

The motivation behind this project is to bridge the digital divide and bring internet access to areas where traditional power sources are limited or unavailable. By utilizing renewable solar energy, the Solar Wi-Fi Router contributes to a greener and more sustainable future.

## Features

- **Solar Power**: The router is equipped with solar panels that capture sunlight and convert it into electricity to power the Wi-Fi router.
- **Energy Storage**: The system incorporates a battery to store excess energy generated during peak sunlight hours, ensuring continuous operation even in low-light conditions.
- **Easy Deployment**: The Solar Wi-Fi Router is designed for straightforward installation, making it suitable for remote locations with minimal infrastructure.
- **Efficient Connectivity**: The router provides stable and reliable Wi-Fi connectivity, ensuring seamless internet access for users.
- **Open-Source**: This project is open-source, encouraging community contributions and improvements.

## Installation

Provide detailed installation instructions here. Include any necessary hardware requirements, software dependencies, and step-by-step installation procedures. You may also include commands for package installation and configuration.

## Usage

Explain how to use the Solar Wi-Fi Router here. Include instructions on how to connect devices to the Wi-Fi network, access the router's admin panel, and any other relevant details.

For example:

1. Connect the solar panels to the Wi-Fi router.
2. Ensure that the battery is charged by placing the router in direct sunlight.
3. Connect your device to the router's Wi-Fi network using the provided credentials (SSID and password).
4. Open a web browser and enter the router's IP address to access the admin panel.
5. Configure the router settings as needed.
