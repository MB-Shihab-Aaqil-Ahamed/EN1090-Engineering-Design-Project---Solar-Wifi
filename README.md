# EN1090-Engineering Design Project - Solar Wifi

## Solar wifi with multiple functionlaity

In this module we were asked build an electronic product/project which solves the real world problems. But luckily as a team, we got an amazing idea, as all the world know, Sri Lanka had faced economic crisis due to the shortage of foreign exhange, because of that shortage of fuel affect all the sectors especially Education and IT Sector. Mainly the power cut was the serious consequence for the Education and IT sector, as all you know due to that problem all the studies were held online, many of the students use wi-fi, light (plays major role in night time)  at all the instances of their educational, IT industrial needs. As an undergraduate, group members altogether collaboratively planned to build above product. When the power gone here we are using LDR circuit to automatically enable the solar circuit to charge the battery until that as usual adapter circuit charge the battery. To indicate the charge levels of battery we are using two(red, green) LEDs when the battery(12V) charge is full red LED turn on until that green will turn on to indicate that the battery(12V) is charging, and we annex the wi-fi, LED to charged battery(12V) to achieve our objective.

## To achieve our objective, We designed
1. PCB Schematic Diagram
2. Proteus Simulation
3. Solidworks
