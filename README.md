## Solar Wifi Router

# Solar Wifi Router

Our team has designed a cutting-edge solar-powered Wi-Fi system that is not only sustainable but also highly functional. We wanted to create a product that would not only address the power shortage issues faced by the Education and IT sectors in Sri Lanka but also inspire people to use more eco-friendly products in their everyday lives.

The design of our product is sleek and modern, with a focus on simplicity and functionality. The system is compact and easy to install, making it perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. The solar panel is designed to capture maximum sunlight, ensuring that the battery is charged quickly and efficiently.

Our product is not just a simple Wi-Fi system, but a multifunctional device that includes LED lights to provide ample illumination in dark environments. The battery charge indicator lights are designed to be easy to read, so users can quickly determine the battery's charge status.

We believe that our solar-powered Wi-Fi system is a game-changer, as it provides a reliable power source that is not dependent on the grid. This product has the potential to revolutionize the way people think about energy usage, by providing a sustainable solution that is both practical and efficient.

Overall, our team is proud to have developed a product that not only addresses real-world issues but also inspires people to be more eco-conscious. We hope that our product will encourage more people to embrace sustainable technologies and help us move towards a greener future
